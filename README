RemoteX is a simple client/server architecture that pickles Python matplotlib arguments and sends them to your local machine to generate the graph.

This library is meant to be used when development occurs on a remote machine, but exporting X11 is slow because it sends all the matplotlib GUI elements.

To use:
1.  Run remoteXserver.py on your local machine
2.  Import remoteXclient.py on your development machine.  Issue commands from the matplotlib.pyplot module as normal, using the methods in remoteXclient.

Set up with SSH port forwarding:

This will use SSH port forwarding to establish the connection between client and server:

ssh user@example.com -R 9898:127.0.0.1:9898
